VPC – 12.0.0.0/16

A /16 network gives 65,536 IP addresses, which is more than enough for this small lab, but still easy to divide into multiple /24 subnets.

Using a single contiguous block makes routing simple and keeps all subnets under one logical network.



Public subnets: 12.0.1.0/24 and 12.0.2.0/24

These are used for internet-facing resources (e.g., bastion host, load balancer, NAT gateway).

Private subnets: 12.0.3.0/24 and 12.0.4.0/24

These are used for internal resources (application servers, databases) that should not be directly reachable from the internet.

Using different third octets (1, 2, 3, 4) clearly separates public vs private ranges and avoids any overlap, which simplifies route-table rules and troubleshooting.
